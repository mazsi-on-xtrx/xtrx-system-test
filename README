integrated test design for the XTRX CS FPGA board.


this design can kill your hardware, use it at your own risk!

seriously: the design reconfigures the on-board Power Manager ICs (PMICs). wrong
settings or a configuration error can result in incorrect voltage on the power
rails, literally frying on-board components.

also, the design was created without documentation on the hardware, so there is
no reason that the applied settings are correct.

please use the design only if you know very well what you are doing.


to build the project from command line (replace 'batch' with 'gui' if preferred):

        vivado -mode batch -source nonproj.tcl
